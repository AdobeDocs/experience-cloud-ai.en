# AI in Experience Cloud

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for AI capabilities across Adobe Experience Cloud applications. This documentation covers how generative AI, AI Assistant, and Adobe agents are integrated into your Experience Cloud workflows to accelerate productivity and enhance decision-making.

## What's included in this guide

### AI Assistant

AI Assistant is a conversational experience that accelerates and optimizes workflows across Adobe Experience Cloud applications. You can use AI Assistant to access specialized agents, gain product knowledge, troubleshoot problems, and find operational insights through natural language interactions.

**Key features:**

- **Conversational Interface**: Full-screen and rail view options for different workflow preferences
- **Discovery Prompts**: Pre-configured prompts organized by category (Learn, Analyze, Optimize)
- **Context Setting**: Configure application, sandbox, and dataview settings for targeted responses
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for data insights
- **Response Verification**: Source citations, reasoning explanations, and feedback mechanisms

### Agent Orchestrator

Agent Orchestrator is the intelligent layer that powers AI Assistant, automatically calling upon specialized agents to provide the right answers. It remembers conversation history, combines insights from multiple agents, and presents unified responses.

**Core components:**

- **Reasoning Engine**: Creates step-by-step plans and adjusts approaches as needed
- **Specialized Agents**: Purpose-built agents for specific tasks and domains
- **Knowledge Base**: Secure access to business intelligence and documentation

### Specialized Agents

#### Audience Agent

Provides insights about audiences including:

- Detecting significant audience size changes
- Identifying duplicate audiences
- Exploring audience inventory
- Retrieving audience sizes

#### Data Insights Agent

Available in Customer Journey Analytics, this agent:

- Answers questions about your data using natural language
- Builds relevant visualizations in Analysis Workspace
- Uses components from your dataview and actual data

#### Journey Agent

Enables Journey Optimizer users to:

- Create, analyze, and optimize journeys using natural language
- Detect and resolve schedule or audience conflicts
- Analyze performance and drop-off points
- Identify top-performing journeys for replication

#### Product Support Agent

Offers self-serve debugging and troubleshooting:

- Troubleshoot Adobe Experience Platform features without leaving workflows
- Create support tickets with context from AI Assistant interactions
- Check ticket updates through AI Assistant

## Getting started

### Access requirements

To use AI Assistant and Experience Platform Agents, your Adobe Admin needs to set up the appropriate permissions:

- **Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer**: Requires "Enable AI Assistant" permission and "View Operational Insights" permission for operational questions
- **Customer Journey Analytics**: Access through Customer Journey Analytics Access Control for product knowledge and data insights questions
- **Adobe Experience Manager**: Access through the Adobe Admin Console

### Privacy and security

AI Assistant is built with privacy, security, and governance at the forefront:

- No personal data is used for training
- All existing access control policies are honored
- HIPAA-ready when used with Adobe Experience Platform Healthcare Shield
- 30-day retention policy for interaction logs
- Sandbox-specific data isolation

## Best practices

- **Be specific** in your prompts to get targeted insights
- **Verify responses** using source citations and reasoning explanations
- **Use context setting** to ensure relevant data sources
- **Provide feedback** to help improve AI Assistant performance
- **Combine insights** from multiple agents for comprehensive analysis

## Legal considerations

- AI Assistant currently supports English only
- Always verify responses as language models can make mistakes
- Review reasoning steps and explanations provided
- Submit feedback for any issues or inaccuracies

This guide provides everything you need to effectively use AI capabilities across your Experience Cloud applications, from basic interactions to advanced agent orchestration and specialized workflows.

## Overview  

The **Experimentation Agent** is an AI-powered tool that modernizes how you can run and manage digital experiments across websites, emails, push messages, and applications. Built on Adobe Experience Platform AI platform and experimentation tools, the **Experimentation Agent** helps you run experiments more efficiently, organize business goals, and generate actionable insights, highlighting what worked, what did not, and where to experiment next.

As part of Experimentation Accelerator feature, the Agent delivers:

* **Performance**: a clear view of what happened in the experiment

* **Insights**: an explanation of why the results occurred

* **Opportunities**: guidance on the next actions to take

## Use Cases    

The Experimentation Agent enhances each phase of the experimentation workflow by analyzing results, interpreting content, and suggesting next steps. 

Its capabilities can be grouped into five key functions:

* **Experiment Summarization**

    Provide a clear, non-technical overview of experiment results for stakeholders.
    
* **Content Analysis**

    Examine the messaging or creative elements of treatments to understand why certain ones outperformed others.

* **Attribute Identification**    

    Categorize treatments by their key attributes, e.g., themes, tones, formats, and connect those attributes to conversion outcomes.

* **Recommendation Generation**    

    Suggest new treatments or adjustments to test, based on insights from prior experiments.

* **Opportunities**

    Identify broader areas or new angles for experimentation to uncover untapped potential.

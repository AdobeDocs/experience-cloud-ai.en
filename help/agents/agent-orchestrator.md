## What is Agent Orchestrator?

Agent Orchestrator is your intelligent assistant for Experience Cloud applications. When you ask a question or request help, Agent Orchestrator understands what you need and automatically calls upon the right specialized agents to get you the answer. It remembers your conversation history, so you can build on previous questions naturally without having to repeat context. Agent Orchestrator combines insights from multiple agents and presents you with a single, clear response. You can complete complex workflows through simple conversation without needing to know which agents are working behind the scenes. If you're curious about how it arrived at an answer, you can explore the reasoning panel to see the step-by-step thinking process.

# Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator

## What is Agent Orchestrator?

Agent Orchestrator is a multi-agent orchestration system built to enable conversational experiences over DX applications. Agent Orchestrator interprets a user's request, determines which specialized agents are needed, and orchestrates them to deliver the right response. It keeps track of context across multi-turn interactions, so users can build on prior queries naturally, and it synthesizes the outputs of multiple agents into a single clear response. This allows users to complete complex workflows in a simple conversational interface without needing to know which underlying agents are being called. The chain-of-thought reasoning and actions taking place under the hood can be explored by the user in the reasoning panel if required.

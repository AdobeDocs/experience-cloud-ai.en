# Adobe Experience Platform Agents usage-bound trial

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Certain eligible Experience Cloud customers may have access to the usage-bound Adobe Experience Platform Agents trial to experience the value of the Agents in their own environment before making the commitment to purchase.

## What is available with the trial

- **AI Assistant**: A full-page, immersive conversational interface powered by Agent Orchestrator and works cross-product, enabling practitioners using enabled Experience Cloud products to leverage GenAI and Agentic AI capabilities. For more information, read the [AI Assistant UI guide](../ai-assistant/ai-assistant-ui.md).
- **Adobe Experience Platform Agents**: Purpose-built AI agents skilled in delivering common jobs across customer experience domain categories. You can leverage Agents to expand your capacity to create and deliver experiences faster and with greater impact, unlocking next level productivity and efficiency. To understand what Agents can be leveraged with each Experience Cloud application, read the documentation on [Agentic AI in Experience Cloud](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/core-services/interface/features/agentic-ai).

## Trial program details

Adobe will determine your eligibility for the trial at its sole discretion. Customers who currently have or previously had an Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator Promotion license or an Experience Platform Agents AI Credits license are not eligible for the trial.

Eligible customers receive an initial one-time allotment of up to 10,000 AI Credits to use for any combination of Jobs (depending on your existing license(s) to Experience Cloud applications) listed in the AI Credit Consumption Table. You can track your AI Credits using the license usage dashboard in the Adobe Experience Platform UI. For more information, read the [license usage dashboard documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/dashboards/guides/license-usage).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>AI Credits only exist for the duration of the trial and **do not roll over** if you license additional AI Credits before using the full 10,000 AI Credit allotment.

The trial ends once you consume the initial one-time allotment of 10,000 AI Credits or licenses additional AI Credits. While you may not immediately lose access or be charged overages, the extension of those benefits is at Adobe's discretion. You must purchase additional AI Credits as soon as the trial is complete in order to continue using Experience Platform Agents without disruption. Please contact your Adobe Account Team for guidance on how to license additional AI Credits.

## Access and Start Using AI Assistant powered by Agent Orchestrator

Users of eligible customers will have default access to AI Assistant and Agents as part of the trial, so no action is needed. Experience Platform Agents are guided by user input and oversight. Agents also honor previously defined product-level access controls, so users can only perform jobs or execute actions for which they have permissions within the applicable underlying Experience Cloud products. If you want to opt-out of access to these Agentic capabilities and disable the trial access, please send a request to [aep-agents-trial-support@adobe.com](mailto:aep-agents-trial-support@adobe.com).

Once you have access, navigate to the Adobe Experience Cloud homepage to get started with AI Assistant. You can use the [discovery prompts](../ai-assistant/ai-assistant-ui.md#discovery-prompts) to view suggestions for prompts and common workflows. Use this feature to help accelerate your onboarding with AI Assistant. Additionally, read the [prompt library](../ai-assistant/prompt-library.md) for a variety of prompts that you can use with different agents. For more comprehensive information, read the [AI Assistant UI guide](../ai-assistant/ai-assistant-ui.md).

For information on the available agents, read the [Agent Orchestrator overview](agent-orchestrator.md).

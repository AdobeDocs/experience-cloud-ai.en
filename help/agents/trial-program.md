# Agent Orchestrator Try-before-you-buy

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>**Select customers now have access to Adobe Experience Platform Agents for a complimentary trial**, enabling you to explore and interact with these Agents through the AI Assistant interface powered by Adobe Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator. The trial offers hands-on experience with AI Agents that operate within the context of customers' existing Experience Cloud products and environments, allowing teams to evaluate value before committing to a full purchase. Adobe Experience Platform Agents are guided by user input and oversight and respect existing product-level access controls, ensuring users can only perform actions or view data for which they are authorized within the underlying Experience Cloud applications.

When you use AI Assistant in Adobe Experience Platform, you interact through a conversational interface: you type or speak a question, and the system translates that into actions across your data, campaigns, audiences, and workflows. Instead of navigating multiple tools, you can "ask" for insights, explanations, or changes—for example, to analyze performance, create an audience, or troubleshoot a setup—and AI Assistant returns answers, visualizations, or deep links into Experience Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer, Customer Journey Analytics, or other digital experience apps. It keeps track of what you've already asked, so you can refine or build on previous questions without restating context.

Behind that experience, Agent Orchestrator is the technical layer that works on your behalf. For every request you make, it interprets your intent, decides which specialized agents or operators to call (and in what sequence), executes multi-step plans, and synthesizes their outputs into a single response you can act on. It maintains conversation state, coordinates reasoning (including planning, verification, and backtracking), and emits trace and usage data so your organization can monitor quality, performance, and credit consumption. In effect, AI Assistant is the surface you interact with, and Agent Orchestrator is the engine that routes, executes, and stitches together the work needed to fulfill your request.

## Try-before-you-buy program details

Your eligibility for the try-before-you-buy trial is fully at Adobe's discretion. Try-before-you-buy is not available to customers who are licensing or have licensed the Experience Platform Agent Orchestrator Promotion SKU or Experience Platform Agents AI Credits SKU.

Customers enabled for Experience Platform Agents try-before-you-buy offer will be entitled to an initial one-time allotment of 10,000 AI Credits to use for any combination of Jobs listed in the AI Credit Consumption Table. Once you use up this initial one-time allotment of 10,000 AI AI Credits, you must transact the Experience Platform Agents AI Credits SKU to purchase AI Credits for continued use of Agents. You can track your AI Credits using the license usage dashboard in the Adobe Experience Platform UI. For more information, read the [license usage dashboard documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/dashboards/guides/license-usage).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>AI Credits only exist for the duration of the trial and **do not roll over** if you license additional AI Credits before using the full 10,000 AI Credit allotment.

The trial ends once you consume the initial one-time allotment of 10,000 AI Credits or licenses additional AI Credits. While you may not immediately lose access or be charged overages, the extension of those benefits is at Adobe's discretion. You must purchase additional AI Credits as soon as the trial is complete in order to continue using Experience Platform Agents without disruption. Please contact your Adobe Account Team for guidance on how to license additional AI Credits.

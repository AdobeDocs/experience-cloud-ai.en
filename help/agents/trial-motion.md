# Agent Orchestrator Try-before-you-buy

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Agent Orchestrator is currently being offered as a trial to a limited group of customers, and you do not need to purchase a SKU to participate.

When you use AI Assistant in Adobe Experience Platform, you interact through a conversational interface: you type or speak a question, and the system translates that into actions across your data, campaigns, audiences, and workflows. Instead of navigating multiple tools, you can "ask" for insights, explanations, or changes—for example, to analyze performance, create an audience, or troubleshoot a setup—and AI Assistant returns answers, visualizations, or deep links into Experience Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer, Customer Journey Analytics, or other digital experience apps. It keeps track of what you've already asked, so you can refine or build on previous questions without restating context.

Behind that experience, Agent Orchestrator is the technical layer that works on your behalf. For every request you make, it interprets your intent, decides which specialized agents or operators to call (and in what sequence), executes multi-step plans, and synthesizes their outputs into a single response you can act on. It maintains conversation state, coordinates reasoning (including planning, verification, and backtracking), and emits trace and usage data so your organization can monitor quality, performance, and credit consumption. In effect, AI Assistant is the surface you interact with, and Agent Orchestrator is the engine that routes, executes, and stitches together the work needed to fulfill your request.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Customers enabled for Experience Platform Agents try-before-you-buy offer will be entitled to an initial one-time allotment of X AI Credits to use for any combination of Jobs listed in the AI Credit Consumption Table. Once you use up this initial one-time allotment of X AI Credits, you must transact the Experience Platform Agents AI Credits SKU to purchase AI Credits for continued use of Agents

## Access and Start Using AI Assistant powered by Agent Orchestrator

To access and use the AI Assistant conversational interface and Experience Platform Agents, your Adobe administrator must assign you specific permissions in either the Permissions UI or the Adobe Admin Console:

- **For Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer**:  
  - You need the **Enable AI Assistant** permission to use the AI Assistant.  
  - You also need the **View Operational Insights** permission to ask operational insights questions in AI Assistant.  
  - Both permissions are managed in the Permissions UI.

- **For Customer Journey Analytics**:  
  - Your administrator must grant access through the [Customer Journey Analytics Access Control](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/technotes/access-control).  
  - This permission allows you to ask product knowledge and data insights questions in AI Assistant.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Operational insights questions are not available for Customer Journey Analytics; therefore, no additional permissions apply.

Once you have the necessary permissions, navigate to the Adobe Experience Cloud homepage to get started with AI Assistant. You can use the [discovery prompts](../ai-assistant/ai-assistant-ui.md#discovery-prompts) to view suggestions for prompts and common workflows. Use this feature to help accelerate your onboarding with AI Assistant. Additionally, read the [prompt library](../ai-assistant/prompt-library.md) for a variety of prompts that you can use with different agents. For more comprehensive information, read the [AI Assistant UI guide](../ai-assistant/ai-assistant-ui.md).

For information on the available agents, read the [Agent Orchestrator overview](agent-orchestrator.md).

>Agent Orchestrator is currently being offered as a trial to a limited group of customers, and you do not need to purchase a SKU to participate.

When you use AI Assistant in Adobe Experience Cloud, you interact through a conversational interface: you type or speak a question, and the system translates that into actions across your data, campaigns, audiences, and workflows. Instead of navigating multiple tools, you can "ask" for insights, explanations, or changes—for example, to analyze performance, create an audience, or troubleshoot a setup—and AI Assistant returns answers, visualizations, or deep links into Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer, Customer Journey Analytics, or other digital experience apps. It keeps track of what you've already asked, so you can refine or build on previous questions without restating context.

Behind that experience, Agent Orchestrator is the technical layer that works on your behalf. For every request you make, it interprets your intent, decides which specialized agents or operators to call (and in what sequence), executes multi-step plans, and synthesizes their outputs into a single response you can act on. It maintains conversation state, coordinates reasoning (including planning, verification, and backtracking), and emits trace and usage data so your organization can monitor quality, performance, and credit consumption. In effect, AI Assistant is the surface you interact with, and Agent Orchestrator is the engine that routes, executes, and stitches together the work needed to fulfill your request.
